<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>If you've ever decided to download mods for a game, the Steam Workshop can make it pretty easy, and you can use an official mod-making tool to make mods like that, which is how I made some of my first mods. These mods were sound mods for Left 4 Dead 2, since I don't know how to use Blender. This guide is going to cover sounds, textures and models, as well as making addoninfo.txt and publishing your mod to the workshop. Other things, such as maps and scripts, are a bit more complex. I'll include links to Youtube videos or playlists on those, as well as videos in case you need further instruction on what I cover. Don't worry if it seems confusing, I myself was confused before doing research for this. However, I think I should go over the requirements first, and I will note which one it's for by adding (S) for sounds, (T) for textures, or (M) for models.</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Steam and Left 4 Dead 2, obviously (STM)</li>
    <li>Left 4 Dead 2 Authoring Tools (STM)</li>
    <li>Notepad/Notepad++ (STM)</li>
    <li>Audacity (S)</li>
    <li>GCFScape (TM)</li>
    <li>Source SDK (M)</li>
    <li>VTFEdit (TM)</li>
    <li>The sound effect/music/model you're modding in (SM)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id= "sounds">
<h2>Sounds</h2>
<p>Difficulty 2/10</p>

<h3>Requirements:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Steam </li>
<li>Left 4 Dead 2</li>
<li>Left 4 Dead 2 Authoring Tools</li>
<li>Notepad/Notepad++</li>
<li>Audacity</li>
<li>The music/sound effect of choice (must be in .wav format)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Pick your song or sound effect of choice, and download it in WAV format.</li>
    <li>Open up Audacity, and make it the same length as the song or sound in the L4D2 files that you're replacing.</li>
    <li>Save it in a new folder with the same name as the WAV file you're replacing. EG. If you're replacing the Tank theme from the campaign finale, name it "taank.wav" and put it in modfolder/sound/music/tank/taank.wav</li>
    <li>Make a file in Notepad called <a href= "#addoninfo">"addoninfo.txt"</a> and put it in the same folder.</li>
    <li>In the "bin" folder of the game files, you will find a file called "vpk.exe", pin it to your desktop and drag the folder to it, this will make your folder a VPK file.</li>
    <li>Put your VPK in the "addons" folder in the game files, boot up the game, and test it out.</li>
    <li>If it works, you're <a href= "publishing">good to go.</a></li>
</ol>
</div>

<div id= "textures">

    <h2>Textures</h2>
    <p>Difficulty 3/10</p>

    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Steam</li>
        <li>Left 4 Dead 2</li>
        <li>Left 4 Dead 2 Authoring Tools</li>
        <li>Notepad/Notepad++</li>
        <li>GCFScape</li>
        <li>VTFEdit</li>
        <li>An image editor</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Look in the game files and open pak01_dir.VPK via GCFScape.</li>
        <li>Search for the thing you're replacing the texture of in GCFScape with CTRL + F.</li>
        <li>Extract the texture files, then put them in your mod folder, using the same directory names as the original files.</li>
        <li>Open your image editor and change the textures, I like to use GIMP since it's open source, and therefore also free.</li>
        <li>Export as a TGA file, then import it to VTFEdit, click "save as", and save them as the VTF files in your mod folder.</li>
        <li>Now add <a href= "#addoninfo">addoninfo.txt</a> to the folder.</li>
        <li>Put your mod folder into vpk.exe, which you hopefully have on your desktop.</li>
        <li>Just like before, test it out. If it works, you're ready to <a href="#publishing">upload it.</a></li>
    </ol>
    </div>

<div id= "models">
<h2>Models</h2>
<p>Difficulty 6/10</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Steam</li>
    <li>Left 4 Dead 2</li>
    <li>Left 4 Dead 2 Authoring Tools</li>
    <li>Notepad/Notepad++</li>
    <li>Source SDK</li>
    <li>GCFScape</li>
    <li>VTFEdit</li>
    <li>A 3D modelling software, such as Blender, Maya or 3DSMax. Use an SMD import/export plugin.</li>
    <li>The model you're using, look it up or make it yourself.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Look in the game files and open pak01_dir.VPK via GCFScape.</li>
    <li>Extract your survivor or infected of choice.</li>
    <li>Make your mod folder, using the same directory names as the file of choice starting with the "left4dead2" folder, replacing the "left4dead2" directory with your mod folder's name</li>
    <li>Decompile the model with the SDK (Crowbar), there will be multiple file types, for now you want to focus on the SMD file.</li>
    <li>Import the SMD into the 3D software. Once this is done, you don't need to repeat steps 1-5 if you're making multiple mods replacing the same survivor/infected.</li>
    <li>Get your model ready, look it up or make it.</li>
    <li>Import the model, now would also be a good time to check the textures</li>
    <li>Match the models, like scaling and such.</li>
    <li>Add some bone weights and adjust the hand so the weapon bone isn't all janky.</li>
    <li>Merge the meshes, and now you can edit the bone weights if you want.</li>
    <li>Now you finally export the model.</li>
    <li>Prepare the model to compile, you'll need to change a couple things in a text editor or programming/coding software like Notepad++.</li>
    <li>Compile your model with the SDK.</li>
    <li>Edit some things in Notepad again to get the textures ready. Including making the survivor and incap icons if your model is replacing a survivor.</li>
    <li>Turn the TGA files into VTF files via VTFEdit.</li>
    <li>Now we're in the final stretch, copy the model files from the game into your mod folder, and add <a href= "#addoninfo">addoninfo.txt</a> to your folder.</li>
    <li>Drag your mod folder into vpk.exe.</li>
    <li>Finally, test it out once more.</li>
    <li>If it works, congrats! Time to <a href= "#publishing">upload it.</a></li>
</div>

<div id= "addoninfo">
<h2>addoninfo.txt</h2>

<p>Your addoninfo.txt file, which goes in the mod folder, not any directories inside it, should say something like this (made a list so they're on different lines). Make it in a text editor like Notepad or Notepad++.</p>
<ul>
<li>"AddonInfo"</li>
<li>{</li>
<li>addonSteamAppID 550</li>
<li>addontitle "mod name here"</li>
<li>addonversion 1</li>
<li>addonauthor "your steam name here"</li>
<li>addonDescription "mod description"</li>
<li>}</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also add an image saved as addonimage.jpg as a thumbnail for your mod while still testing it out, just put it in the mod folder alongside the other directories your mod is going through and the addoninfo.txt, this is optional though.</p>
</div>

<div id= "publishing">
<h2>Publishing Your Mod</h2>
<p>Once you've tested your mod and made sure it works, the next step is to publish it to the Workshop. Here's how to do it:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Open the Left 4 Dead 2 Authoring Tools.</li>
    <li>Click "Workshop Manager" then click the [+].</li>
    <li>Fill the details out, the name, description, mod thumbnail (not necessarily your addonimage.jpg, if you even added one), and categories (the checkboxes).</li>
    <li>Check "I accept the terms of the Steam Workshop Contribution Agreement" and click "Upload".</li> 
</ol>
<p>Congrats, you just uploaded your mod to the Workshop, you can now take the VPK out of the "addons" folder and subscribe to it on the Workshop, and other people can enjoy it too.</p>

<h2>Outro and other links</h2>

<p>Well, that's that done. Again, this isn't everything you can mod. Some examples of each type that was shown here would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replacing a gunshot with the Vine boom</li>
<li>Giving Ellis a new shirt</li>
<li>Replacing the Jockey with a little kid who wants piggyback rides</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are just some examples, you can just look in the files and go wild with it. I hope you enjoyed this guide, and I will add some links both to Youtube, in case you want to watch another tutorial, or in case you want to read another one instead, a Steam community one, for what I've covered, and some that I haven't, like scripts or custom maps. I suggest checking some of these out, since this wasn't exactly a fully comprehensive guide.</p>
